5. Usage

The taglist plugin can be used in several different ways.

1. You can keep the taglist window open during the entire editing session. On
   opening the taglist window, the tags defined in all the files in the Vim
   buffer list will be displayed in the taglist window. As you edit files, the
   tags defined in them will be added to the taglist window. You can select a
   tag from the taglist window and jump to it. The current tag will be
   highlighted in the taglist window. You can close the taglist window when
   you no longer need the window.
2. You can configure the taglist plugin to process the tags defined in all the
   edited files always. In this configuration, even if the taglist window is
   closed and the taglist menu is not displayed, the taglist plugin will
   processes the tags defined in newly edited files. You can then open the
   taglist window only when you need to select a tag and then automatically
   close the taglist window after selecting the tag.
3. You can configure the taglist plugin to display only the tags defined in
   the current file in the taglist window. By default, the taglist plugin
   displays the tags defined in all the files in the Vim buffer list. As you
   switch between files, the taglist window will be refreshed to display only
   the tags defined in the current file.
4. In GUI Vim, you can use the Tags pull-down and popup menu created by the
   taglist plugin to display the tags defined in the current file and select a
   tag to jump to it. You can use the menu without opening the taglist window.
   By default, the Tags menu is disabled.
5. You can configure the taglist plugin to display the name of the current tag
   in the Vim window status line or in the Vim window title bar. For this to
   work without the taglist window or menu, you need to configure the taglist
   plugin to process the tags defined in a file always.
6. You can save the tags defined in multiple files to a taglist session file
   and load it when needed. You can also configure the taglist plugin to not
   update the taglist window when editing new files. You can then manually add
   files to the taglist window.
