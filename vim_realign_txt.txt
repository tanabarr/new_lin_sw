You can force a reformat of a paragraph by executing the commands:

Command	Explaination
1.	 	Move to the top of the paragraph.
2.	gq}	The "!" command tells Vim to pipe a section of text through a filter. The } tells Vim that the section of text for the pipe command is a single paragraph.
3.	fmt -70	The UNIX command fmt is a primitive formatter. It performs word-wrapping well enough for text documentation. The -70 tells fmt to format lines for 70 characters per line.
