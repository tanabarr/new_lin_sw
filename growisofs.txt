growisofs can be used to burn a DVD

Need to know device name of DVD drive

growisofs -Z /dev/dvd -R -J /some/files

To append:

growisofs -M /dev/dvd -R -J /some/files

(/Dev/dvd is just a symbolic link to reference the right device e.g./dev/hdc)
DVD drive can be mounted only as read-only in the normal fashion.

Has to be done as root, notsudo 
if the disc has been written to in Windows, may not work. Need to be blank.
