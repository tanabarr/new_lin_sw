Either need to build solely on CMS development system or install build system on standalone Tilera development system.
Mym requires mym version > 0.6, cleversheep version > 0.2.3, python 2.4 

HTML documentation under tests directory is also on li wiki
newbuilds on LI use a setup script for the common tools (on the Cronus share "software" under common tools). These packages are contained in/software/common tools/packages.

Testing for the LTM is contained within the test directory: test/process/probe/flip/ look up...
readme file is very useful

/*****************************************//*****************************************/
Installed python from source tarball version 2.4.4../configure, make and then after changing to root, make install. python2.4 binary now globally accessible.
Similar methods install cleversheep & Mym
cleversheep:
tar zxvf ${TOOLS}/CleverSheep/dist/CleverSheep-0.3.3.tar.gz
cd CleverSheep-0.3.3
python2.4 setup.py install --force
cd /tmp
rm -rf CleverSheep-0.3.3

Mym:
same as above in directory with the python command.


__________
even with these tools installed, Mymmainfile gets confused because of missing infrastructure?? How to extract a barebones build?

Cgcc_li is in the cms common_tools mounted directory (unfortunately not in the common_tools default installation packages).

Mount common tools directory from local storage system if not enough space.

(no "BINFO" description between linking and install descriptions at end of build output -mym)

test/Process/probe/flip/lookupTableManager
>mym clean

Neither builds, build time errors in jdp_stub.c (missing definition for data type: Timeout_entry). A fixed on revision 77400, replaced with data type Timeout_id.

Trunk builds correctly. Test directory contains readme of how to configure mym build and environment to run test correctly.

Standalone directory still doesn't do mym because of the following error:

I wonder if you could help, I'm trying to resolve the build error: ...PyLibs/Mymfile", line 98, in makePyLibSet	makeShared (progName=alias)

The trunk/build/bi script executes in python2.6 as the shebang dictates (when spawned as a subprocess). I hadn't realised the build system used 2.6 as well as 2.4.
Solution is to fix the symbolic links and file permissions under/common_tools/x86_64.
2.7 GB, can be burned to DVD. Doesn't include/common_tools/generic which may be required.

Removed buildinfo and net_snmp include mymfiles from ~ltm/support/Mymfile. Not needed apparently.

	problem with creating display. 
Local monitor not displaying correctly, troubleshooting included a power cycle on the server and monitor boot into BIOS. Auto login enabled for user (Tom) chkconfig check for vncserver, when checked using PS utility,X11vnc process should be running. Initial vnc seems not to be running. Possible problem with IP tables, shutdown service using "sudo service iptables stop". Start instance of vncserver, this starts a new display :2. Now the should work on LAN
	proper solution requires chkconfig vncserver levels to be active on three, four, five. This is so that user can have auto log in and create display before vnc tries to share. Changed the vnc password to user password. Check what run levels are in Centos. Even with the following steps correctly, still not starting up correctly.
	When adding ./vncserver to bash_profile, Need to make sure no .vnc/*.pid exist before starting from bash shell.
Not a fail proof technique. Tunnel connection through putty.


	When building LTM test, as in the readme, ensure traffic mount is in the right place and TRAFFIC_DIR environment var set to the base of this location. Ensure correct file structure.
Adjust permissions on the files as well as /usr/share/configs/ltm_config (file and directory writable by others).

	Add environmental variable settings and vncserver to bash_profile.

	When executing test harness, blank xterm. Make sure /var/log/limpit he's writable by user. And then message is not getting through as before. Configs/default.py seem to be okay?? Can't run mym config because wx is unknown module.
