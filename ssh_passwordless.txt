TEMP=`cat source_file`
ssh remote "echo $TEMP >> destination_file"

cat source_file | ssh remote 'cat >> destination_file'


password-less SSH example

Ssh-keygen -t dsa
(accept defaults, keys in ~/.ssh)
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh remote 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2'

That's it, in the simplest case. If it doesn't work, check the remote ssh config for the desired target user. Best using ssh-agent to keep track of pass phrases.
