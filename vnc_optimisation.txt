TightVNC optimisation for remote use

If using SSH obviously setup tunnelling and set keep alive under the connection tabs in options

Use 8-bit colour encoding and custom compression level=7 under tightVNC options, JPEG compression quality=6 (but greyed out)

For a LAN connection use 8-bit encoding and "raw" schema to avoid slow refresh issues.

Vncserver walk-through on Red Hat related OS: http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/VNC-Server



Troubleshooting with pal(centos).
Not automatically starting.
Reinstall and re-setup vnc-server. Ensuring correct use of root.
Add local host name to/etc/hosts.
With check config, start only on run level 5

Only starts using vncserver as user from shell
(could put in .bashrc?) 
Need to make sure no .vnc/*.pid before starting from bash shell.
Not a fail proof technique.
