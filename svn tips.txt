SVN information


you have to login to svn, the password is "password" - assuming that you have 
an LI account (if not, charlie should be able to create one).

toroise will work - there are people who use it.  However, there are a few 
things to bear in mind:

1) we use a commandline wrapper for svn called sub that we use for all 
branching and merging tasks
2) every checkin must be against a bug in bugzilla, and every bug has it's own 
branch, this means that the first line of every checkin is "Bug: <bugno>", 
except that merges have two bug numbers.  it's possible that tortoise will 
have a field for the bug number in the top right - I can't remember if that 
is setup as I don't use it myself, if it does then it will add the 
appropriate line to the front of the provided commit comment.

The basic procedure for work is:
 a) create bug in bugzilla
 b) create bug branch using sub from appropriate dev branch (a dev branch is a 
branch that relates to a feature development as opposed to a single piece of 
work - nothing is done directly on dev branches they are just places for 
combining individual pieces of work together)
 c) devlop code on bug branch with the bug no in all checkin comments (btw sub 
add the bug line to the commit message for you)
 d) tag the branch as complete (this doesn't mean that no more work can be 
done on the branch - just that the work that has been done is ready to be 
shared)
 e) merge the bug branch to dev branch
