Uses the tex metalanguage
sample taken from:
http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/html_node/Short-Sample-Texinfo-File.html#Short-Sample-Texinfo-File

Example of how to compile from source:

  889  makeinfo.exe exm.texi
  890  texi2pdf --help
  891  texi2pdf --tidy exm.texi
  892  makeinfo.exe --html exm.texi

TAN@ITW92620 ~/documentation/exemplar
$ ls
exm.pdf  exm.t2d  exm.texi  sample  sample.info

Commands create the previous listing (pdf and temporary file directory t2d, the source texi file, HTML directory and info file.

Source file modified for each document, replace names as required.

Use @include <filename including extension>, to include plain text contents (could also include TeX directives etc) in a section.

Pay attention to indexing, referencing for example, after directives like @cindex,@node @chapter

Useful commands:
@…
quotation (on its own line,end with @end quotation)
noindent (affects the next in line)
paragraphindent none (globally disables indenting, put this just before the end of header)
xref
url

@enumerate < number or letter to start with.>
@item
…
@item
…
@end enumerate

@itemize is the same as above but with bullets

Makeinfo pointer creation (automates creation of node pointers in document)
-- NO need to include next, previous and top pointers on node lines, these are automatically done by makeinfo as long as it's formatted correctly
--our menus created as well?
