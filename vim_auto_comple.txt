omnicppcomplete set up
as per Les Harris's blog post: http://blogs.gnome.org/lharris/2008/07/20/code-completion-with-vim-7/

Edited .vimrc file to automatically update tags in current directory
provided key map to update tags without closing session (C-f6)
add a tags file from home user directory containing tags of/usr/include directory
add a small function to execute auto complete on "tab" key.

Extract script contents to ~/.vim/

Auto complete works on objects and pointers. Doesn't really work on anonymous class objects.
