cygwin_sshd_configurations

If sshd had been previously installed on the system, the following cleanup should be performed before invoking ssh-host-config:

# Remove sshd service
cygrunsrv --stop sshd
cygrunsrv --remove sshd
# Delete any sshd or related users (such as cyg_server) from /etc/passwd
#   (use your favorite editor)
# Delete any sshd or relaged users (such as cyg_server) from the system
net user sshd /delete
net user cyg_server /delete

initial steps to install:

cygwin packages (rerun setup if necessary -- you can add packages after you have already installed Cygwin).

Admin --> cygrunsrv
Net --> openssh

Open a new bash shell window and run the SSH configure stuff.

ssh-host-config

This step whttp://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24628_01/install.121/e22624/preinstall_req_cygwin_ssh.htmill create necessary configuration files, a priviledge separation user and necessary directories.

When prompted with "CYGWIN=" type for following:

tty ntsec

Now you are ready to start the service.

cygrunsrv -S sshd


now run ssh-host-config

doesn't seem to work, can't logon with local user, cyg_server logs out after displaying splash screen(cygwin)

----

referring to the top following documentation:


http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24628_01/install.121/e22624/preinstall_req_cygwin_ssh.htm

set CYGWIN environment variable in cygwin.bat to align with above value (tty ntsec).

tan password change to ^2A

solution was to add password for cygwin user and use correct character case in login name!
