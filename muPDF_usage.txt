Using Mu PDF

MuPDF is a more keyboard friendly PDF reader than Adobe Acrobat reader.
The Adobe product is more flash/air based and therefore doesn't respond as easily to keyboard control. It is geared towards point-and-click type usage and the voice recognition "say what you see" paradigm doesn't work quite so well.
Very simple program which doesn't seem to crash or have unexpected results, exactly what you need when trying to control with voice recognition.
</> Do page up/down 10 pages, very useful for quickly browsing through documents. can use m/t as in vim for Mark/trace back to previous mark, can also use a list of 10 marks e.g. m[0-9]/t[0-9].

One less frustrating program to deal with.
