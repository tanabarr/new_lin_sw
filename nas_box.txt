NAS box set up
logged onto port 80, changed admin password and enabled FTP on web console
enabled Samba share on custom smb.conf (browsable=yes) although not sure if this will get overwritten by ipstor software.
Trying to mount Samba drive on Linux (can just create standard nfs share to transfer files in Linux? Avoid Samba overhead).
Need to mount using type smbfs ("sudo mount -t smbfs -o username=tom,password=??? //NAS/tom /media/baxter")
it gets error about superblock and file type, search for file system helper: ("ls /sbin/mount*"), if this doesn't contain smbfs install it (sudo sudo apt-get install smbfs). This gives ability to mount using cifs or smbfs filesystem types.
Can check Samba shares on network ("smbclient -L NAS").
File permissions and ownership seem messed up for Samba directory when mounted using:
"//192.168.1.191/tom /media/baxter smbfs username=tom,password=??? 0 0" appended to/etc/nfstab

Use "//192.168.1.191/homes /media/baxter smbfs rw,user,sync,auto,uid=tom,gid=tom,username=tom,password=siemens 0 0"
instead

Get error when moving or copying to mount; "accessing '/media/baxter': host is down"

See NFS_shares for how to set up these
