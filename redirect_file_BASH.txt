To redirect to file stderr/out both do: 1>> file.txt 2>&1 (order is important)
can use exec to do this for the whole script

to redirect stdout to file with elevated permissions, have to use sudo sh -c "echo 'text' > /file.txt"
to avoid the issue of changing permissions of a builtin (which is what trying to use sudo to elevate the permissions of a shell implicit redirection action is)
we need to execute in a subshell)
