Red Hat use chkconfig (or systemd) (/sbin)
Debian use sysv-rc-conf but now upstart job initialisation is preferred on Ubuntu
use example "initctl emit <event>" for Ubuntu initialisation control

To help reinforce the difference, consider how Upstart itself starts: See the Startup Process.

It performs its internal initialization.
Upstart itself emits a single event called startup(7). This event triggers the rest of the system to initialize. Note that there is no "startup" job (and hence no /etc/init/startup.conf file).
init(8) runs the mountall job (as defined in /etc/init/mountall.conf) since the startup(7) event satisfies mountall(8)'s requirement: "start on startup".
The mountall(8) job in turn emits a number of events (including local-filesystems(7) and all-swaps(7)). See upstart-events(7) for further details. As a thanks mate
Upstart provides three different types of Events.
(For mounting problem on BTX, examine fstab for delay option and also /etc/init/rc.Local to see when it is executed by upstart
(arrange for correct upstart behaviour for both deluge{d,-web,} and x11vnc. Add unprivileged user to logon with automatically? And password for deluge)

(Both as root)
both now use the "service ... start/stop/restart" paradigm for processcontrol

Generic ways to autostart Demons:

To run a daemon or any command as root before login, add it to /etc/rc.local or add a cron job with @reboot as its time field. You can also write a proper init script based on /etc/init.d/skeleton.
To run a command after login, add it to ~/.bash_profile (provided you're using bash). Contrary to ~/.bashrc, this file will be executed by login shells only.
To run a command after login of any new user, add an appropriate .bash_profile to /etc/skel and new users will get this file automatically on account creation.
