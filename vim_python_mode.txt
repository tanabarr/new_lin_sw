vim python mode

Betty installed from clean (i.e. with no python vim modifications)
shortcut keys for switching vim  Windows and python mode specific keys all need mapping
e.g. for auto run from within vim ,python documentation, ctrl-space "rope" auto completion, breakpoints set/unset (currently s-b)

Todo: install plug-ins as bundles using pathogen
pdb plug-in needs installing?
